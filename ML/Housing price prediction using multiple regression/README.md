# Housing-Price-prediction
This is a very basic ML project for absolute beginners . This is a project on Multiple Regression , which is an extended version of Linear Regression , when the dataset has more than 1 feature for a particular label .
The best part is that I have used the mathematical algorithm to make the learning model . Then later Sykitlearn is also used to check how good the mathematical model is making predictions .
